1,Drawbridge & Khey Mysterio - Psylmodie,Kellyne,"You make your way through the streets of the darkened city, hugging the walls and venturing cautiously into the alleys. 
The distant noise of the main streets fades as you move further away. You come to a halt in front of a closed shop, its window hidden by a thick red curtain: the first stage on your journey.
",Gaze at your reflection in the glass,"Your vision blurs and the world dissolves into darkness. All you hear is the blood pounding in your temples. You regain consciousness sitting on a hill, far from the city; dawn his here.","The cliffs in the distance, the coastline battered by dark waves. ","Tu trouves un vélo abandonné, appuyé contre un arbre. On dirait qu’il t’attendait. 
"
2,Anta Doma - Shapes ,Piero,"A narrow path winds between the cliffs to a beach, made up of millions of shells bleached white by the salt water. 
Strange figures rise up from the ground: some vague, others like arrows shot toward the sky, and still others in the form of half-emerged human faces. 
Between the dunes stands an immense sculpture, like a coral reef pierced with thousands of tiny hole.",Listen to the sound of the wind going through the sculpture,"Your eyelids slowly close, and you can feel yourself sinking. When your eyes, the wind has died down. The music has stopped, and your body is half buried in seashells.","You depart from the shore as quickly as possible, your heart full of sorrow, across the dunes.","As if in a dream, you fray deeper and deeper into the salt marshes beyond the dunes."
3,Naeja May The World Ends (With You),Piero,"A small road winds through the countryside. The evening is cool and pleasant. You see the lighted sign of a store by a small canal, its colorful neon lights shining in the setting sun. 
The small room lined with shelves is deserted, a radio crackling in the corner.",Sit down on the bench by the canal to watch the sunset.,The scent of lakeside flowers and the smell of mud hang in the air. You sigh. A cat stares at you from afar.,The greenery soon gives way to the foothills of the desert.,Strange traces of rust and soot form a path toward the horizon.
4,acideplastique - Vectorial Soil,Johanna,"Red sand dunes stretch as far as the eye can see, crowned by the darkness overhead, dotted with glimmers of light and several crescent moons. 
You walk looking up, observing the motionless ballet of the stars, losing yourself among the undulations of the desert. Suddenly, you feel something sharp under your shoe.",Cautiously lift your foot,"Barely emerging from the ground, a stony rose with translucent petals reflects the glow of the moons above. You have found the only flower in all this vastness. 
",In the heart of the desert lies a half-buried city.,A small hut overlooks the highest dune.
5,Le Frit - Streetview belly slide,Victor,"You push through a wall of reeds and splash through the murky waters of an impenetrable mangrove swamp. Beneath the surface, a multitude of small, luminescent amphibious creatures wriggle around your legs and seem to lead you through the roots.",Follow the little swamp folk,"You watch the fluorescent swirls undulating at your feet, dimly lighting the darkness, like a reflection of the stars hidden by the canopy.",The creatures slide into an underwater well. You take a deep breath and dive in with them.,"You climb a tangle of roots and emerge from the water, reaching the top of a tree and finally seeing the sky."
6,Nostrodamus - Another Presence,Piero,"Wedged between two trees lies a large spaceship. It has already had visitors, judging by the breach in its side. You slip inside and walk along the rust-colored corridors, marked with white chalk inscriptions. You cannot read these markings, which appear to be written in dozens of different languages. In a remote room of the aircraft, a pale fresco covers everything, and white chalk sticks lie scattered on the floor.",Try and make out the words on the cold steel,"Verse I

Nostromodamus travels, and we travel with him
Collector of footprints, of biotope truths
A ship that seeks, a ship that finds
But what finds us in return?

Verse II

The core has acquired a taste
The core observes the observers
In the frequencies: messages
In the signals: a presence
That which studies learns to desire
That which measures learns to see

Verse III

In clubs we wander, souls suspended, music suspended
No more comfort, no more poetry
Only the hum
The psychoacoustics of floating minds
Frequencies passing through us as we pass through space

Verse IV

Mechanics of vertigo, mechanics of dance
From the torn ground to the ship
For the ship observes us
We are the others
We are the footprints
We are what changes when seen","The airship points toward a barren plateau in the distance, where the glow of a wood fire flickers. You slide out of the ship and walk toward the light.",You tear off one of the ship's propeller blades and use it as a machete to continue your journey through the forest.
7,Gustave Retour - Le piège,Victor,"You walk among the ruins of an ancient city, green stone columns barely supporting mosaic-covered domes. At its heart, you discover a small square surrounded by a wild garden, in the middle of which stands a statue. Its eyes are closed, its body leaning slightly forward, and the sight of it fills you with a sense of peace you haven't felt in a long time.

A stream of clear water flows from between it's lips.",Drink from the statue's mouth,Feel the cold of the water and stone on your lips,"A spire rises on the horizon, like a wound in the glowing sky; your journey is coming to an end.",
8,Aquacrypt - Cairn Path Reuptake,Kellyne,"You clamber up a gravel path on the hillside. You pass a small tin shack with its door flung wide. Amidst a jumble of machines, cables, and flashing lights, a small creature with bright red skin, its face hidden behind a thick moustache, mumbles into a microphone. It looks up when it hears you coming.",Wave at the little fellow,"The little creature goes on mumbling, too softly for you to hear, without taking its eyes off you nor returning your greeting. ","A spire rises on the horizon, like a wound in the glowing sky; your journey is coming to an end.",
9,Smogo - Obliteration ,Piero,"A petrified forest of ancient  trees stands before you, their dark branches overgrown with moss.

The silence is so profound, the air so still, that you can hear the sound of your footsteps and the echo of your breath.

You are exhausted from your journey and must stop for a moment to collect yourself.",Lean against a tree trunk to rest for a while.,"First a whisper, then a groan, then a scream: the ancient forest collapses. In a matter of moments, only dust and wind remain.","A spire rises on the horizon, like a wound in the glowing sky; your journey is coming to an end.",
10,Damna - 3CSO,Piero,"A stretch of black rock runs along a lagoon, its surface polished and smoothed by the wind and saltwater. 

In the center, a rocky promontory rises up towards the sky, its peak hidden by clouds.

You approach a pool, left between the folds of the reefs by the tide, overflowing with life, a tangle of iridescent shells and translucent filaments. 

You plunge your face into the cold water.",Listen to the secret music of the deeps,"You remain submerged longer than should be possible, listening to the rustling of appendages on the seabed and watching the slow ballet of phosphorescent algae.
","The tide has receded. At the base of the granite pillar in the center of the bay, a flight of steps carved into the stone leads to the top.",
11,Zero Crossing Point - Half Past Six,Piero,"You've no idea how long you've been climbing the steps, and you're not even breathless when you reach the summit. Above, a protruding ledge rises from the clouds, like a bridge stretching across the heavens.

You gaze out, down at the landscape stretching as far as the eye can see beneath your feet. Each region you have passed through appears as the colored threads of a tapestry, and now the tapestry is unraveling ; the map is dissolving, the ground is contracting, expanding, fading away; the landscape undulates and vanishes, and soon all that remains is you, crossing  a narrow corridor suspended in the middle of an infinite expanse.

Reaching the end, you stretch out your hand. Like a click, a window opens into the void. ","Without a moment's hesitation, you step forward, cross the threshold, and disappear.  ",,,
